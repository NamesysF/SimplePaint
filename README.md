# Simple Paint

## What is that?
This is a simple paint for drawing. It's not surprising.

## Why was it created if there are many other drawing apps in this world that are much better?
The developer just wanted to create something of his own. He is too lazy to continue developing this application further, so he publishes it to his repository with the hope that someone will want to improve this program knowing that no one cares about it.

## This program does not have a license, what can I do with it?
Everything you want...
